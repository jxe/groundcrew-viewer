<h2>Here's how to get started&hellip;</h2>
<h3 class="toggles tutorial1_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial1">1. Send yourself a test message</h3>
<div class="tutorial1_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
  <p>Click on yourself in the top bar (or on the map &ndash; either works). Type 'test' and hit 'Send'.</p>
  <p>You'll receive it as a text message, unless you've installed the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/groundcrew/id358863993">iPhone app</a>, in which case you'll get a notification.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="toggles tutorial2_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial2">2. Reply to your test message</h3>
<div class="tutorial2_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
  <p>From your phone, reply to the test message you just sent.</p> 
  <p>After a few seconds that reply will appear on the map, in the upper-right as a notification. Click on it if you see it.</p>
  <p>If you miss the notification, the reply is permanently in two other locations:</p>
  <p>1. Recent Activity &ndash; down on the bottom-right</p>
  <p>2. The responder&rsquo;s profile &ndash; click on yourself on the map or in the top bar</p>
</div>

<h3 class="toggles tutorial3_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial3">3. Update your location</h3>
<div class="tutorial3_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
  <p>Start by clicking on yourself &ndash; up top or on the map &ndash; so you&rsquo;re visible before proceeding&hellip;</p>
  <p>From your phone, send another reply: start with &ldquo;at&rdquo; (no quotes) followed by a location &ndash; a street address and city, zip code, or even just a city (though the location won&rsquo;t be very precise).</p> 
  <p>If Groundcrew can correctly interpret the new location, you&rsquo;ll get a confirmation message on your phone, and your location on the map will move.</p>
  <p>Note: if your location updated involved changing cities, use the city-picker in the upper-right to re-locate yourself.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="toggles tutorial4_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial4">4. Invite new agents</h3>
<div class="tutorial4_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
  <p>Click on 'Recruit' down at the bottom, and select 'Invite via email'.</p>

  <p>When agents join, they'll appear if the map is targeting their city.</p> 
  
  <p>To make sure you see all agents regardless of their location, zoom out until 'Worldwide' appears as the location in the upper-right.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="toggles tutorial5_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial5">5. Create your first mission</h3>
<div class="tutorial5_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
  <p>Tip: try this on yourself if there are no other agents.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike a message, missions require agents to accept and then notify you when completed.</p>

  <p>Click 'Send' (next to 'Recruit'), then choose 'A Mission'. Next, click on the map where the mission needs to happen. Finally, add details about your mission.</p>

  <p>Once you've created the mission, you can access your in-progress mission from the 'Ongoing' menu at the bottom.</p>
