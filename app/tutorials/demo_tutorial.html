  <p style="margin-top:15px;">The people to the right are fake. But interact with them the right way, and maybe they&rsquo;ll still respond&hellip;</p>

  <h3 class="toggles tutorial1_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial1">1. View someone&rsquo;s details</h3>
  <div class="tutorial1_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
    <p>Click a person on the map. Now click another on that 'facebar' up top. It&rsquo;s the same list, just grouped by location or availability.</p> 
    <p>In either case, when you click on someone, you're seeing their profile.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggles tutorial2_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial2">2. Send a message</h3>
  <div class="tutorial2_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
    <p>See the text box at the bottom of someone&rsquo;s profile? Go ahead, send a message. They&rsquo;ll probably ignore you.</p> 
    <p>If this were real, that person would get a text message or iPhone notification.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggles tutorial3_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial3">3. Check out skills/interests</h3>
  <div class="tutorial3_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
    <p>Still got a profile up? Good. The 'Tags' section lists skills/interests. (No tags? Try another person.)</p> 
    <p>Now click on a tag. It&rsquo;ll appear in the search box up top, and only people who have that tag are shown.</p>
    <p>To see all tags, hit the arrow just right of search. Want to go tag-free? That red 'X' will do the trick.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggles tutorial4_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial4">4. Start a mission</h3>
  <div class="tutorial4_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
    <p>The Send menu down the bottom has some tricks. Start a mission at a specific location that way.</p> 
    <p>Those agents should finally start responding. You should see them accept and complete the mission (and maybe send in a mission report).</p>
    <p>If this were the real deal, your agents would receive missions and reply from their phone. Phone-shy? Then they&rsquo;d get email.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="toggles tutorial5_tutmode" href="#tutmode=tutorial5">5. Create a landmark</h3>
  <div class="tutorial5_tutmode hidden_unless_active">
    <p>The Landmarks menu in the upper-right already has some listed, but you should create your own landmark, too.</p> 
    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to start missions at landmarks. Great if a certain location is used often.</p>
    <p>Oh hey, looks like you reached the end. There&rsquo;s a few more tricks, but you&rsquo;re well on your way to being a mobile organizer. Congrats!</p>
