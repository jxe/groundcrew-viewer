<h2>
  Welcome to the Groundcrew Interactive Demo
</h2>

<p>The people you see on the map and in the facebar are demo people that you can try messaging with, without bothering real people. Â Here are some things to explore:</p>

<ul>
<li> click people on the map, or in the facebar above, to see their profile and send a message</li>
<li> click tags to automatically search for more people with the same skills or interests</li>
<li> send messages by typing in the profile box</li>
<li> in the facebar at the top of the screen, people are grouped by whether they are available, whether they are already in a mission, etc.  these groups can be collapsed and expanded</li>
<li> the little photos on the map are landmarks.  click one and run a mission with the people nearby</li>
<li> you can also start missions at other locations from the grey console bar at the bottom of the screen</li>
</ul>
