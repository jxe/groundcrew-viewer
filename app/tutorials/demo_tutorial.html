  <p>Here&rsquo;s some things to try&hellip;</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Click people on the map, or in the facebar above, to see their profile and send a message or mission invitation.</li>
    <li>From a profile, click tags to automatically search for more people with the same skills or interests.</li>
    <li>In the facebar at the top of the screen, people are grouped by availability.These groups can be collapsed and expanded. Send someone on a mission to see their status change.</li>
    <li>You can also start missions at other locations from the gray menu bar at the bottom of the screen. </li>
    <li>The little photos on the map are landmarks. Click one and run a mission with the people nearby</li>
  </ul>
